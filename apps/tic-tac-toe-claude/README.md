# Tic Tac Toe Claude

The above screenshot is from a fully working app in Claude's environment. This
feature is called a Claude artifact.

### Prompt

1. Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game for me in React. It should allow the user to play
   against the computer.
2. The computer's algorithm for making the next move seems to be extremely dumb.
   Can you make that algorithm extremely smart so that it gives a tough
   competition to the user?

**Claude:** You're absolutely right. The current algorithm for the computer's
move is indeed very basic, just choosing a random empty square. Let's improve it
to make the computer a formidable opponent. We'll implement the Minimax
algorithm, which is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player
games like Tic-Tac-Toe. This will make the computer play optimally, making it
very difficult for the user to win.

### Conclusion

1. Claude produced an excellent result in just two prompts. Not only does the
   game look aesthetically pleasing, it is hard to beat.
2. The generated code was JavaScript, which took a little effort to run with
   Typescript.
